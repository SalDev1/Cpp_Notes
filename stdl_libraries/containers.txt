STDL is made up of three elements:- Containers , Iterators and Algorithms and Functions.

Containers:- (Is of three types)
1] Seqeuence Containers. ==>  Stores in linear fashion. 
Eg:- vector , list , dequeue.

2] Associative Containers.  ==> Provides direct access or increasing the efficiency of searching , deleting or inserting ,etc.
For faster search, faster deletion , faster insertion.
Eg:- Map , Multimap , set , multiset.

3] Derived Containers / Container Adaptors ==> real world modelling.
Eg:- stack , priority_queue , queue.

According to GFG.
1] Sequence Containers.
2] Container Adaptors. 
3] Associative Containers.
4] Unordered Associative Containers.

1] Sequence Containers:-
   
a] Vector ==> If you want to access third or fifth element using the vector library. 
Random Access(Fast)
Insertion/Deletion in middle(Slow)
Insertion/Deletion at the end(Fast).

b] List ==> 
Random Access(Slow).
Insertion/Deletion in middle(Fast).
Insertion/Deletion at the end/begin(Fast).

2] Associative Containers :- All operations fast , except Random Access.
If you want to store data in this , like contact numbers , names , etc. Use this.


3] Derived Containers:- Depends ==> Analysis done in Data Structure.
