The Standard Template Library(STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common
programming data structures and functions such as lists , stacks , arrays, etc. 
It is a Library of container classes , algorithms and iterators . 

It is a generalized library and so, it's components are parameterized.

A working knowledge of template class is a prerequisite for working with STL.
It has four components:-

STDL:- Helps you to avoid reinventing the wheel.
Algorithms :- Sorting , Searching , uses template functions.
Containers :- It is an object that stores data , uses template classes. 
(Character or Integer Container ,etc)
Functions
Iterators : = It is an object that points to an element in a Container , Handles just like pointers.
Connects Algo with containers. (Vectors)

Mainly we are using stdl libraries to
