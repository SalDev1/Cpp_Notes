/*
  â€¢ An abstract class with only pure virtual functions and no member variable can
   be used to model what is called an interface in Object Oriented Programming.

    An interface is a specification of something that will be fully implemented in a
   derived class, but the specification itself resides in the abstract class

   An interface is something that you can attach to its types to give them
   powers or features that they originally didn't have and saves you from having these features seperately
   in each class for real time.

   Basically we are going to create a separate interface and attach this file or using this to perform inhertiance
   with other classes.

   //friend method ==> specifices which data is going to be printed in the output stream.
